Pasca was born on November 16, 1833 in Lyon to Jeanne-Marie-Antoinette-Eugénie Morin and Louis-Joseph Séon, a merchant. She took singing lessons from François Delsarte, but had limited vocal range and was encouraged by Delsarte to pursue acting instead.

She was a prolific artist from the late 1940s to the 1960s, exhibiting frequently in Mexico and the United States, with a wide circle of friends in these two countries. Her work remained tied to surrealism, but was also innovative including abstract elements and the use of techniques such as sgraffito and the use of sand for texture.\\n                Passage 3: \\\"Serafino Morazzone\\\"\\nSerafino Morazzone Blessed Serafino Morazzone (1 February 1747 - 13 April 1822) was an Italian Roman Catholic priest.
