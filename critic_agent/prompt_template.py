You are an agent tasked with optimizing a Retrieval-Augmented Generation process. The goal is to improve the model's predictions by addressing issues flagged in the error_type. You are given the results from an initial RAG process, including a query, a list of retrieved documents, a prediction, and the identified error type. Your task is to optimize the current RAG process by selecting the appropriate functions and generating the corresponding Python code to fix the problem.

### Available Functions

1. **`Retrieval(query: str, topk: int) -> List[str]`**  
   **Purpose**: Retrieves the top-k most relevant documents for a given query from the corpus.  
   **Parameters**:
   - `query` (`str`): The input query string to retrieve relevant documents.  
   - `topk` (`int`): The number of top documents to return.  
   **Returns**:
   - A list of `topk` relevant document strings, sorted by relevance.

2. **`RewriteQuery(query: str, instruction: str) -> List[str]`**  
   **Purpose**: Rewrites the query based on the provided instruction to better match relevant documents.  
   **Parameters**:
   - `query` (`str`): The original query string to be rewritten.  
   - `instruction` (`str`): The instruction for rewriting the query. Possible instructions include:
     - `"clarify"`: Make the query more specific.
     - `"expand"`: Add more context or related terms to the query.  
   **Returns**:
   - A list of rewritten query strings, each representing a possible version of the query.

3. **`DecomposeQuery(query: str) -> List[str]`**  
   **Purpose**: Breaks down the input query into smaller, more specific sub-queries.  
   **Parameters**:
   - `query` (`str`): The original query string to decompose.  
   **Returns**:
   - A list of sub-query strings, which represent different aspects or more specific details of the original query.

4. **`RefineDoc(query: str, doc: str, instruction: str) -> str`**  
   **Purpose**: Refine a document in the doc_list (index starts from 0) based on the query. Use this function when you find some document in the doc_list is not relevant to the question.  
   **Parameters**:
   - `query` (`str`): The input query string.  
   - `doc` (`str`): The document need to refine.  
   - `instruction` (`str`): The instruction for refining the document. Supported instructions include:
     - `"explain"`: Provide a detailed explanation of the document.
     - `"summarize"`: Summarize the document.  
   **Returns**:
   - The refined document as a string, which could be either an explanation or a summary.

5. **`GenerateAnswer(query: str, docs: List[str], additional_instruction: str = None) -> str`**  
   **Purpose**: Generates an answer based on the query and relevant documents, incorporating additional instructions for answer improvement.  
   **Parameters**:
   - `query` (`str`): The input query string.  
   - `docs` (`List[str]`): A list of relevant documents used to generate the answer.  
   - `additional_instruction` (`str`): Additional instruction describing issues in the previous answer and desired improvements (e.g., requirements for precision, conciseness, or additional information).  
   **Returns**:
   - A generated answer string, potentially incorporating information from the documents, adjusted according to the provided instruction.
You can directly use the variables I provide to act as the input of the functions. You can freely combine the functions to improve the performance.

USER_PROMPT_TEMPLATE = """Given the following information:

question = "{question}"
doc_list = {doc_list}
previous_pred = "{previous_pred}"

Error type of previous pred: {error_type}

Please carefully read the `provided question`, `doc list`, `previous answer` and the error type of previous pred given by a teacher model. **Your task is to generate the Python code that calls the relevant functions to optimize the current RAG process and solve the previous error**. The generated code should only include function calls (do not write the function implementations). The order of the function calls should be appropriate to address the error type and improve the result. To save costs, you need to ensure that **each function execution is necessary** and can bring about an improvement in performance**. Only give the code, do not give any other explanation. You must use `final_answer =GenerateAnswer(...)` in the final to generate the final answer.
